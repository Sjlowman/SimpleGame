# SimpleGame

A simple JS game

Possible enhancements:

1. Change the colour of the ball to a different random colour every time it hits the wall and/or blocks
2. Make the ball speed up somein some way (eg every other time you "hit" the ball with the paddle, it speeds up slightly. Or every 5. Maybe change the colour of the ball when it speeds up)
3. Change the colour of the bricks (eg, each row has different colours)
4. Change the GAME OVER from being an alert to a message on the screen. Need to have a way to make the game restart in that case (at the moment it's delayed/triggered by the alert)
5. Have levels. Either just a linear progression (eg at each level the ball gets faster, you have more blocks etc).
6. Moving to a non-linear/choose your level from a menu

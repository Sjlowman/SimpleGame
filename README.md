# SimpleGame

A simple JS game

Possible enhancements:

1. Change the colour of the ball to a different random colour every time it hits the wall and/or blocks
2. Make the ball speed up somehopw (eg every other time you "hit" the ball with the paddle, it speeds up slightly. Or every 5. Maybe change the colour of the ball when it speeds up)

# SimpleGame

A basic JS game
Based on the MDN web tutorial of a simple JS only game

Possible enhancements:

1. Change the colour of the ball to a different random colour every time it hits the wall and/or blocks
2. Make the ball speed up in some way (eg every other time you "hit" the ball with the paddle, it speeds up slightly. Or every 5. Maybe change the colour of the ball when it speeds up)
3. Change the colour of the bricks (eg, each row has different colours)
4. Change the GAME OVER from being an alert to a message on the screen. Need to have a way to make the game restart in that case (at the moment it's delayed/triggered by the alert). Make it require a particular keystroke (maybe N).
5. Have levels. Either just a linear progression (eg at each level the ball gets faster, you have more blocks etc).
6. Moving to a non-linear/choose your level from a menu
7. Change the paddle to a space-ship style that shoots missiles to destroy the blocks, and add missiles coming in the opposite direction to make the game hard enough to be enjoyable.
8. Add a main menu that allows the user to chose which mode they want to play (paddle or space-ship)
9. Add the bug splatting game from webinar
